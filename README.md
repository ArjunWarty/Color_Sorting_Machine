# Color-Sorting-Machine
Implementation of Sorting of Red, Green, Blue and Other Colors for M & M chocolates using an Infrared(IR) sensor, a color sensor and 2 PWM signaled servo motors for sorting using Arduino Uno Development Board with a 16x2 Serial Graphic Display and Arduino IDE.

Modifications can be made to the code to seperate multiple color of the color spectrum and the application may be used for other color sensing and detection applications as per need.

Code is ready to use once the hardware is built and connected to the respective pins on the board. 

The time delays may vary depending on the length of the tubes used for sorting and the reaction speed and motor controls of the Servo's.

The Documentation folder contain sample codes and examples for libraries created by other people and can be used as study material and reference for modification of the code.
